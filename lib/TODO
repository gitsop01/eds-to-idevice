ORIGINAL TO-DO FILE ITEMS

* error reporting is non-existant (a GError is passed in most places where
it matters, but it's never set)
* we should try harder to preserve IDs sent by the device (in particular
the last value in the a/b/c triplet used for multi-valued fields)
* the API can probably be improved in places
* this hasn't been tested at all for partial syncs
