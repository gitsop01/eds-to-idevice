This fork is a development fork for gtk3 updated to the lastest libraries.

Used to sync contact info between Evolution data server and an idevice.

This code is in the progess of updating to the latest EDS version 3.18.3 and 
compiled with the latest libimobiledevice library 1.20 and GTK3 3.18 library

This code has successfully transferred 440 EDS contacts to an idevice
and should compile on most Linux distributions but must be running 
Evolution Data Server as the Source of the synced contacts.
One way sync only.
